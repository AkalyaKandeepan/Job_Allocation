# Job_AllocationThe project helps to allocate the pending work to different non-teaching staffs and also checks the status of completion of the allocated task. By allocating tasks in such a manner, identifying and assigning pending jobs become easier. It also helps in tracking the effort of
the non-teaching staffs towards the effective completion of the task assigned to them.
